I am an open-source enthusiast and an aspiring machine learning engineer/data scientist. While at school, I enjoy learning about topics that machine learning can be applied to in a meaningful way. I'm currently a Software Developer Intern at Kings Distributed Systems.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in Kaggle competitions, hackathons, and learning more about machine learning through MOOC's and conferences.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8uWUOSGYUI) is my talk at PyData Boston-Cambridge and its accompanying [code](https://github.com/stanleyjzheng/PyData)

The highlights of my Kaggle competitions and hackathons [can be found here](https://gist.github.com/stanleyjzheng/96f3455c2ae8842b90f175fc34bd63e6)
